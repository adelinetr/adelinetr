## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adelina (or Adaline) from Estonia. Currently I live in Lithuania and do front-end developemnt along with web-design. 
- I really enjoy implementing designs and include a pleasant intuitive user experience.
- I also enjoy working with React.js framework, however currently I'm also upgrading my skills by learning about React and Redux in-depth through several courses and my own research to fill up certain knowledge gaps:)
